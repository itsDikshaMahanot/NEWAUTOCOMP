               Node: SGTCOMNASA003-02
           Resource: Slot: 0 Port: 13 10G - Level
           Severity: Major
    Indication Time: Wed Mar 25 10:24:49 2020
           Suppress: false
        Acknowledge: false
     Probable Cause: The cable used to connect switch
                     "SGPTCOMNASACLINT-SW01/Slot: 0 Port: 13 10G - Level"
                     to the ISL port might be faulty.
    Possible Effect: Cluster redundancy might be lost.
 Corrective Actions: 1) Check whether the cable is fully inserted into the interface port on both ends.
                     2) Reconnect the ISL port using another cable. After
                     reconnecting it, verify whether the link of the ISL
                     port is up by executing the commands as per switch
                     configuration guide or by checking whether the Link
                     status LED is on.

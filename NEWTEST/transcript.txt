Xiaolin (2/3/2020, 11:30:36 AM): I just located your case and found your case owner is off shift. Do you mind me leaving a case note to let the engineer to contact you when he/she is available, or you prefer to reassign the case to the next available engineer 
Me (2/3/2020, 11:31:13 AM): This is regarding the case 688213940 and the cisco engineer " Poojitha " is the case owner.
I would like to know what is the status of the case as Feild Engineer was to be assigned for today after 6PM CST. 
Me (2/3/2020, 11:33:30 AM): Kindly reassign the  case to available engineer in this shift.
And also would like to know the current status whether the FE is assign or not
